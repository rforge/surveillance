## 2017

- 2017/05/03: A standard reference describing the spatio-temporal modelling
  frameworks of the package has appeared in the Journal of Statistical Software:
  <https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v077.i11>.
  Sections 3 to 5 of this paper are available as
  - [`vignette("twinstim", package = "surveillance")`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=surveillance/vignettes/twinstim.pdf)
    to analyze a spatio-temporal point pattern of infective events
  - [`vignette("twinSIR", package = "surveillance")`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=surveillance/vignettes/twinSIR.pdf)
    to analyze the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) event history of a fixed population
  - [`vignette("hhh4_spacetime", package = "surveillance")`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=surveillance/vignettes/hhh4_spacetime.pdf)
    to analyze areal time series of infectious disease counts

## 2016

- 2016/11/30: We arranged a small surveillance hackathon as part of the
  ESCAIDE 2016 conference in Stockholm, Sweden. One output is a set of
  [tutorials](https://surveillancer.github.io/tutorials/) on how to use
  the package.

- 2016/05/20: A standard reference describing the monitoring aspects of the
  package has appeared in the Journal of Statistical Software:
  <https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v070.i10>.
  This paper is also available as
  [`vignette("monitoringCounts", package = "surveillance")`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=surveillance/vignettes/monitoringCounts.pdf).

- 2016/04/13: A paper on [model-based testing for space-time interaction using
  point processes](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sste.2016.03.002)
  describes a new global test for clustering based on the endemic-epidemic point
  process model `twinstim()`.

- 2016/03/31: The paper [A system for automated outbreak detection of communicable
  diseases in Germany](https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.13.30180)
  describes use of the package as backbone for the German infectious
  disease monitoring system.

- 2016/01/21: The paper [Bayesian nowcasting during the STEC O104:H4 outbreak in
  Germany, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.12194),
  which builds on the **surveillance** package, won the **Best 2014 Paper in
  Biometrics by an IBS member** award. The award will be given at the
  IBC 2016 in Victoria, Canada.

## 2015

- 2015/12/03: Working paper on incorporating age-structured social
  contact data in the spatio-temporal `hhh4` model for stratified, areal
  time series of infectious disease counts: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01065>

- 2015/09/21: ISDS Webinar on *Aberration Detection in Public Health
  Surveillance using the R package `surveillance`*.
  ([recording](https://vimeo.com/140669369),
  [material](https://sites.google.com/site/rapplicationforbiosurveillance/home/meetings))
